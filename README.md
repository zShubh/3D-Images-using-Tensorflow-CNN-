# 3D-Images-using-Tensorflow-CNN-

Objective: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying MRI images, focusing on 3D image data.

Environment Setup: TensorFlow 1.0, Anaconda 4.3.8, Python 2.7

Challenges in Training 3D Medical Image Models:

Large Data Volume: MRI images typically have substantial dimensions, such as 218x182x218 or 256x256x40, leading to large datasets.
Limited Data Availability: Medical datasets often contain a small number of samples, making it difficult to train models effectively.
Minimal Differences in Images: MRI images of different subjects often appear very similar, with only slight variations.
Potential Approaches:

Hardware Optimization: Utilize high-performance machines with sufficient RAM to handle large datasets.
Image Downsampling: Reduce the resolution of images during preprocessing to manage data size.
Data Augmentation: Apply techniques such as rotation, shifting, and combining images to artificially increase the dataset size.
Transfer Learning: Leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them on the medical dataset to improve performance.
